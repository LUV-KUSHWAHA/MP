CHAPTER 1  
INTRODUCTION  
 
This chapter should discuss the background of the research/project issues being dealt with, 
the statement of the problem, project objectives, significance of the study, and scope and 
limitation of the study .  
Introduction must revolve around the central research/project issue.   
 
1.1 Background  
 
Brief background of the issues should be discussed under the background section. It should 
be done in the form of a brief literature review of related literature, wh ich is essential to 
build a statement of the problem, research question, and research objectives in the later part 
of INTRODUCTION chapter  
 
1.2 Motivation  
 
Explain about the motivating factor that inspired you to carry out this project.  
 
1.3 Statement of t he Problem  
 
This section must indicate what the problem is, why and how it is a problem. Similarly, the 
necessity to conduct the research should also be discussed. It should be supported by data 
or evidence. This section should be well connected with the b ackground section and as 
brief as possible.  
 
 
 

2 
  
1.4 Project objective  
 
This section should clearly mention what you want to achieve from the research. Usually objective 
is presented as general objective and specific objectives. The general objective of res earch should 
be only one and should be in line with the title. To meet the general objective, several specific 
objectives could be set. Specific objectives should be in line with research questions and are more 
or less equal in numbers of research question s. 
 
1.5 Significance of the study  
 
The importance of this research /project  should be stated in this section, in terms of potential 
beneficiaries & the way they will be benefitted. The section should focus on justifying the 
topic of the proposed research.

CHAPTER 2  
LITERATURE REVIEW  
 
Literature review is basically a survey of published materials on the topic of interest 
authored by accredited scholars and researchers. It is quite important to uncover what is 
already known in the body of kn owledge prior to initiating any research (Hart, 1998). 
Hence, it is a crucial endeavor for any academic research in theoretical and conceptual 
progress (Shaw, 1995 and, Webster and Watson, 2002). Thus, it helps to situate your 
research in the context of wh at is already known about the topic and find the gap that your 
research will bridge.

CHAPTER 3  
REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS  
 
This chapter includes about projects requirements  (hardware and software requirement),  
Functional and non - functional requirements of the project and feasibility study of your 
project.

CHAPTER 4  
SYSTEM DESIGN AND ARCHITECTURE  
 
This chapter includes th e discussion about the way you conducted your project in order to 
meet the objectives. The System design and Architecture should be summarized in the form 
of block diagram /flowchart. Selected methodology should be discussed in details along 
with the justi fication of selecting the methodology. It should include project design (DFD 
Diagrams, Use Case Diagrams, ER Diagrams etc...),

CHAPTER 5  
METHODOLOGY  
 
This chapter includes the discussion about the way you conducted your project in order  to 
meet the objectives. It may contain the same thing (blocks or units) that have been 
explained in chapter 5. But the explanation should be in detail in a particular sequence in 
which you have done your work along with detail algorithms, procedures, circ uit diagrams 
or others which illustrate the “how” part in detail.  
Example:   
Preprocessing block --- write down what and how it does along with different algorithms 
or diagrams that you have designed or used.  
In few of the projects the chapter 4 and 5 ma y be combined together into “System (or 
Project) Design and Methodology”

REFERENCES  
 
The arguments in the project should be supported by proper evidences. This needs to be 
done by referring to ear lier publications such as patents, journals, books, reports, thesis and 
other materials. Hence, referencing gives credit to the authors or organizations for using 
their work in your thesis. It provides the reader with evidence of the breadth and depth of 
researchers reading and enables readers to locate the references easily.   
It is strongly recommended to follow the IEEE referencing  format for the project.  The 
referencing should be consistent on IEEE referencing .
