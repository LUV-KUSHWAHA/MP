    "## 1) Executive Summary (comparison)\n",
    "- Proposal objective: Build a web-based Location-Based Recommender System (LBRS) for selecting caf\u00e9 locations in Kathmandu using multi-source spatial data (OSM, Google Places), ward census, road network; perform buffer-based spatial feature engineering, compute multi-criteria suitability, and train an ML model (Random Forest) to predict suitability for caf\u00e9 type.\n",
    "- Mid-term status (before update): report template present but lacked several completed engineering items listed in the proposal (amenities counting by type, exact population computation per-area, dataset integration and API endpoints).\n",
    "- Action taken: implemented backend Amenity model, loaded OSM amenities (9,265 records), added amenities and population endpoints, integrated population calculation based on ward boundaries (WKT), and updated frontend to fetch and show amenities and exact population in the full report modal.\n"

    "## 2) What has been completed (concrete deliverables)\n",
    "- Backend:\n",
    "  - Added `Amenity` model (DB table `amenities`) to store OSM amenities (osm_id, amenity_type, name, lat, lng, GeoJSON point).\n",
    "  - Implemented and migrated model (`makemigrations`/`migrate`).\n",
    "  - Created management command `load_amenities` to bulk-load `notesForMP/osm_amenities_kathmandu.csv`; loaded 9,265 amenities.\n",
    "  - Implemented API endpoints:\n",
    "    - `GET /api/amenities/?lat=&lng=&radius=&type=` \u2014 list amenities of a given type within radius.\n",
    "    - `POST /api/amenities-report/` \u2014 returns counts and top listings for key amenity types (school, hospital, bus_station, cafe, health_post, pharmacy) for a selected area.\n",
    "    - `GET /api/area-population/?lat=&lng=&radius=` \u2014 returns wards intersecting the buffer and total population (uses shapely WKT parsing for accurate geometry calculations when shapely is available).\n",
    "- Frontend:\n",
    "  - Updated `map.js` to call the new endpoints on \"View Full Report\" and render:\n",
    "    - Exact population in the selected buffer area (total and per-ward breakdown).\n",
    "    - Counts and brief listings of amenities by type.\n",
    "  - Report modal now shows amenity counts and top few names, affected wards with population and density, ML probabilities, recommendations.\n",
    "- Data & Tools:\n",
    "  - Amenities CSV (`notesForMP/osm_amenities_kathmandu.csv`) imported into DB.\n",
    "  - Ward boundaries: ward boundary WKT strings loaded; used Shapely for robust WKT parsing and distance checks.\n",
    "- Repro steps executed (examples run during development):\n",
    "  - `python manage.py makemigrations api`  # created amenity migration\n",
    "  - `python manage.py migrate`\n",
    "  - `python manage.py load_amenities --csv notesForMP/osm_amenities_kathmandu.csv`\n",
    "  - Start servers: backend on port 8000 and frontend `python -m http.server 5500` in `frontend/` folder.\n"

    "## 3) Detailed theory and methods (to include in the updated mid-term report)\n",
    "This section should be included in the revised mid-term report as the expanded Theory/Methodology chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Multi-source Data Acquisition\n",
    "- OSM amenities (points): schools, hospitals, bus_stations, cafes, pharmacies, health_posts. Collected as CSV: `osm_amenities_kathmandu.csv`.\n",
    "- Cafe dataset (Google Places / harvested dataset): contains place_id, name, type, lat/lng, rating, review_count.\n",
    "- Ward census: ward population, households, area, population_density and geometry stored as WKT polygons.\n",
    "- Road network: OSM/GeoJSON linestrings to approximate road accessibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Spatial Feature Engineering (buffer analysis + counts)\n",
    "- For a selected location (lat, lng) and radius R (meters):\n",
    "  - Create circular buffer centered at (lat,lng) with radius R.\n",
    "  - Count features whose coordinates fall inside the buffer for each amenity type.\n",
    "  - Distance calculation uses haversine formula for point-to-point checks; for polygon checks (wards), use geometric point-in-polygon via WKT/SHapely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Haversine distance (meters):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta\\phi = \\phi_2 - \\phi_1\\\\\n",
    "\\Delta\\lambda = \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_1\\\\\n",
    "a = \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\phi}{2}\\right) + \\cos(\\phi_1)\\cos(\\phi_2)\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\Delta\\lambda}{2}\\right)\\\\\n",
    "c = 2\\arcsin(\\sqrt{a})\\\\\n",
    "d = R_{earth} \\cdot c\\\\\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $R_{earth}\\approx6371\\,km$ and angles are in radians.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Population calculation for the circular buffer\n",
    "- Approach used in code (practical, mid-term): identify all wards whose polygon contains the point or intersects/comes within the buffer (tested by polygon distance in meters). Sum population of affected wards to produce a conservative estimate. When shapely is available we:\n",
    "  - parse ward WKT into a polygon object,\n",
    "  - create a Point(longitude, latitude),\n",
    "  - if polygon.contains(point) \u2192 ward fully affected,\n",
    "  - else compute polygon.distance(point) (in degrees) and convert to meters (approx. degree-to-meter conversion ~111000 m/deg); if distance <= radius \u2192 treat ward as affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This is conservative (counts whole ward population if any part intersects). For better accuracy use areal intersection fraction (clip polygon by buffer, compute area fraction and multiply by ward population). That requires polygon intersection and area calculation (Shapely can provide exact area in degrees; convert to projected CRS for area in m^2). Recommended next step: reproject geometries to an equal-area projection before computing polygon intersection area.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Multi-Criteria Suitability Analysis (MCSA)\n",
    "- Criteria used (example implemented):\n",
    "  - Competitor density (number of caf\u00e9s within R) \u2014 lower competitor count increases suitability.\n",
    "  - Road accessibility (approx. road length or number of road segments within R) \u2014 higher road length increases suitability.\n",
    "  - Population density (population/area) \u2014 higher increases suitability.\n",
    "- Scoring (current simplified implementation): normalize each criterion into [0,1] and weight them (example weights: competitor 40%, road 30%, population 30%). Combine to produce 0\u2013100 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ML prediction\n",
    "- Features used (example): [total_competitors, avg_rating, approximate_road_length_m, population_density].\n",
    "- Model: Random Forest classifier/regressor (trained offline) \u2014 returns predicted suitability label (e.g., High/Medium/Low) and confidence/probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Frontend UX flow (how report is produced)\n",
    "- User pins a location -> optional cafe type selection -> app sends location + radius + cafe_type to backend `/api/analyze/` to compute suitability and top-5 competitor cafes.\n",
    "- For full report: frontend calls `/api/amenities-report/` (POST) and `/api/area-population/` (GET) to fetch amenity counts and population breakdown and renders them in modal.\n"

    "   - Libraries: Shapely + pyproj or GeoPandas. If GeoPandas is used, prefer installing geopandas with binary wheels (Windows note in requirements).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ML model improvements and evaluation:\n",
    "   - Retrain with expanded features: distance-weighted competitor counts, amenities counts by type as features (schools, hospitals), road centrality metrics, POI categories.\n",
    "   - Perform k-fold cross-validation, report precision/recall/F1, ROC-AUC where applicable.\n",
    "   - Save best model artifact and document training dataset & hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. UX and reporting enhancements:\n",
    "   - Add map overlays showing amenity points by category inside buffer.\n",
    "   - Allow export of report to PDF (server-side HTML\u2192PDF rendering or client-side print CSS).\n",
    "   - Pagination/expandable lists for amenity listings when counts are large.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Deployment & reproducibility:\n",

    "   - Document data sources, collection dates, and update process for OSM & Google data.\n",

We created three new API endpoints \u2014 amenities listing, multi-amenity report, and area population \u2014 which enable the frontend to display exact population and amenity counts in the selected buffer area. On the frontend, the report modal now visualizes these results, showing per-ward populations and key amenity counts, along with ML-based suitability scores.
