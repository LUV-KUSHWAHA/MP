 CHAPTER 1 
INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background 
Choosing the physical location for a business is a decision of strategic importance that 
significantly influences the survival and performance of a company [1]. In the 
hospitality sector, particularly for cafes and restaurants, location is often considered the 
most critical determinant of success. Traditionally, these decisions were based on 
intuition or basic observation, weighing factors such as population density, local 
economic conditions, and accessibility [1]. However, with the rapid urbanization of 
cities like Kathmandu, the complexity of these variables has increased, transforming 
location selection into a multi-criteria decision problem that requires sophisticated 
analysis rather than simple estimation. 
The emergence of Location-Based Recommender Systems (LBRS) has provided a 
technological solution to this challenge. LBRS are specialized context-aware systems 
that utilize geographical data to provide users with timely and relevant items or 
information [3]. By integrating Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with machine 
learning techniques, it is now possible to process vast amounts of spatial data such as 
competitor locations, road networks, and demographic data to generate actionable 
business insights [4]. While traditional recommender systems focus on suggesting 
products to users, a business-oriented LBRS focuses on recommending the optimal 
location or business type for a specific area. 
This project proposes a web-based application designed to assist entrepreneurs in 
Kathmandu Metropolitan City. By leveraging spatial data from OpenStreetMap and 
Google Maps, combined with demographic data, the system analyzes the "business 
influence area" to evaluate suitability and predict the success of new cafe ventures using 
machine learning algorithms like Random Forest. 
1.2 Motivation 
The primary motivation for this project stems from the high failure rate of new 
establishments in the food and beverage industry. Statistics indicate a harsh reality 
where a significant percentage of restaurants fail within their first year, often due to 
suboptimal location choices and an inability to adapt to the local market saturation [2]. 

      
 
2 
 
 Chain restaurants may afford to close underperforming outlets, but for small-scale 
entrepreneurs in Kathmandu, a wrong location choice can lead to irreversible financial 
loss. 
Furthermore, there is a lack of accessible, data-driven tools for local investors. Most 
existing systems are descriptive rather than prescriptive [2]. There is a growing need 
for "Prescriptive Analytics" in business location selection systems that not only analyze 
the current state but also recommend the best course of action [2]. This project is 
motivated by the desire to bridge this gap, providing a user-friendly platform that 
democratizes access to complex spatial analysis and machine learning predictions, 
ultimately fostering a more sustainable business ecosystem in Kathmandu. 
1.3 Problem Statements 
Despite the availability of map services like Google Maps, entrepreneurs in Kathmandu 
face significant challenges in assessing the viability of a potential cafe location. The 
core problem lies in the difficulty of manually aggregating and analyzing dispersed 
spatial data to make an informed decision. Specifically, the problems addressed by this 
project include: 
a) Information Asymmetry: 
Entrepreneurs often lack a consolidated view of critical parameters such as 
competitor density, population demographics, and road accessibility within a 
specific radius of a proposed site. 
b) Subjectivity in Decision Making: 
Without a quantitative system, decisions are often driven by intuition, leading 
to businesses opening in oversaturated areas or missing opportunities in 
underserved locations [1]. 
c) Lack of Predictive Insight: 
While a user might know where existing cafes are, they often lack the analytical 
tools to predict what type of cafe (e.g., Coffee shop vs. Bakery vs. Restaurant) 
would be most suitable for a specific neighborhood based on market gaps and 
historical data. 
d) High Failure Risks: 
The inability to accurately assess the "co-location" patterns in which types of 
businesses thrive near each other increases the risk of business failure [2].

 1.4 Project Objective 
General Objective: 
To develop a web-based cafe location recommendation system that utilizes GIS and 
Machine Learning to assist users in identifying the most suitable cafe type for a specific 
location in Kathmandu Metropolitan City. 
Specific objectives: 
a) To develop an interactive web interface that allows users to pin specific 
locations in Kathmandu and visualize spatial data, including existing cafes and 
road networks, within a specified radius buffer. 
b) To analyze site suitability parameters by integrating diverse datasets (Google 
Maps, OpenStreetMap, and Population Census) to calculate competitor density, 
road accessibility, and business influence. 
c) To implement Machine Learning models that predicts the most suitable cafe 
type for a selected area based on identified market gaps and saturation levels. 
d) To provide actionable recommendations by displaying the top 5 existing cafes 
and suggesting one optimal new cafe type to open in that location, or the 
specified cafe type in another location. 
1.5 Significance of the Study 
The system reduces the uncertainty and financial risk associated with opening new 
businesses. By providing a data-backed recommendation (e.g., suggesting a "Bakery 
Cafe" where there is high footfall but low competition), it aids in strategic decision-
making [1]. 
The project demonstrates the application of GIS in analyzing urban business 
distributions. It highlights how "co-location" patterns the tendency of certain businesses 
to cluster can be quantified and used for planning [2]. 
The project showcases the successful integration of web-based GIS visualization with 
backend Machine Learning logic. It contributes to the field of Location-Based 
Recommender Systems (LBRS) by moving beyond simple "nearest neighbor" searches 
to complex, multi-criteria suitability prediction [3].

2.2 Summary of Literature Review 
The review of existing literature highlights a significant evolution in location selection 
strategies, moving from manual, intuition-based decisions to sophisticated, data-driven 
approaches. Early methods and broad reviews, such as those by Sujithra & Surendiran 
[3], established the foundation of Location-Based Recommender Systems (LBRS), 
emphasizing the importance of geo-tagged data and user context. Building on this, 
studies like Perez-Benitez et al. [1] and Sarath et al. [4] demonstrated the power of 
integrating GIS with Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) techniques like AHP. 
These studies successfully validated that mathematical weighting of spatial factors 
(such as road accessibility and land use) yields highly accurate suitability maps, though 
they often focused on macro-level city selection or industrial zoning rather than small 
business needs. 
More recent advancements, particularly by Han et al. [2], have introduced machine 
learning and "Prescriptive Analytics" into the domain. By utilizing advanced algorithms 

      
 
6 
 
 like Graph Convolutional Networks, researchers have begun to model the complex "co-
location" patterns of how specific businesses thrive when clustered near certain other 
types. However, a distinct gap remains for a localized, accessible tool for Kathmandu. 
Most existing systems are either too computationally complex for general users or lack 
the specific micro-level focus on cafe types (e.g., predicting "Bakery" vs. "Coffee 
Shop"). This project aims to bridge this gap by combining the proven GIS suitability 
analysis methods of [4] and [5] with a machine learning prediction model tailored to 
the specific urban dynamics of Kathmandu Metropolitan City. 
2.3 Research Gap 
Despite the extensive research in location suitability analysis, significant gaps remain 
when applying these methodologies to small-scale commercial enterprises like cafe in 
developing urban centers. Existing studies, such as the work by Perez-Benitez et al. 
(2021) and Sarath et al. (2018), predominantly focus on macro-level analysis ranking 
entire cities for investment or selecting large industrial zones which lacks the micro-
level granularity required to evaluate specific street corners or neighborhoods for a 
coffee shop.  
Furthermore, while recent advancements by Han et al. (2024) have introduced 
sophisticated deep learning models for location prediction, these systems are often 
computationally intensive and focus on binary suitability (whether a location is "good" 
or "bad") rather than recommending the optimal business type (e.g., Bakery vs. Cafe) 
from multiple options. 
Additionally, traditional GIS approaches, as seen in Onyekwelu et al. (2024), are 
frequently tailored to agriculture, relying on physical factors like soil and slope while 
neglecting dynamic socio-economic indicators such as competitor density and market 
saturation that are critical for the hospitality industry. 
Finally, comprehensive reviews like those by Sujithra & Surendiran (2020) provide 
theoretical frameworks but highlight a lack of practical, hybrid systems that effectively 
solve the "cold start" problem for new businesses without historical data. This project 
aims to address these limitations by developing a specialized, web-based tool that 
combines micro-level spatial analysis with machine learning to provide accessible, 
type-specific recommendations for Kathmandu's cafe entrepreneurs.

widely used. The availability of APIs like Google Maps and open data from 

      
 
9 
 
 OSM ensures that the necessary spatial datasets can be retrieved and integrated 
effectively. 
3.4.2 Economic Feasibility  
The project is economically feasible because it primarily utilizes open-source 
technologies (Python, Leaflet, PostgreSQL). The primary costs involved are 
related to API usage (Google Cloud) and hosting, which can be managed within

 CHAPTER 4 
SYSTEM DESIGN AND ARCHITECTURE 
4.1 System Architecture Design 
 
Figure 1: Design of System Architecture 
This diagram illustrates the structural layers of the map-based cafe location 
recommendation system for Kathmandu Metropolitan City. The User Interface and 
Application Layer represent the web-based platform where users sign in via Google, 
interact with the Kathmandu Metropolitan City map, select cafe types, and pin locations. 
The Machine Learning Models layer utilizes algorithms like Random Forest to process 
spatial and historical data including market gaps and competitor density to predict ideal 
business types. Supporting this is the Data Layer, which integrates the project's multi-
source datasets from Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, and Population Census records to 
determine site suitability within a 500m radius. 
4.1.1 User Interface Layer 
The User Browser is the platform through which the user accesses the system using a 
web browser such as Chrome or Edge. It allows the user to open the website, sign in 
with a Google account, and interact with the map-based features of the application. The 
Web Interface provides the visual and interactive elements of the system. It includes 
the login page, cafe selection options, buttons, forms, and result panels. This interface 
captures user inputs such as cafe type selection, map pin location, and recommendation 
requests, and sends them to the application layer for processing. The Interactive 
Kathmandu Map displays a zoomable and clickable map of Kathmandu Metropolitan 


      
 
11 
 
 City. It allows users to pin a location, view a 500-meter radius area (default), see 
existing cafes, and visualize suitability using heatmaps. This component enables 
intuitive location-based interaction and presents analysis results in a user-friendly 
manner. 
 
Figure 2: User Interface Layer 
4.1.2 Application Layer 
 
Figure 3: Application Layer  
Google Authentication Service allows users to securely sign in using their existing 
Google account. It ensures authorized access to the system before users can interact 
with the Kathmandu Metropolitan City map and cafe analysis features. Application 
Controller manages all user requests such as cafe selection, map pinning, and 
recommendation requests. It controls the workflow and coordinates communication 
between different system modules. GIS Processing Module processes the pinned map 
location and creates a 500-meter analysis radius. It extracts spatial data such as existing 
cafes, roads, and nearby facilities using Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, and census data. 
Suitability Scoring engine evaluates how suitable the selected location is for the chosen 
cafe type. It analyzes factors like competition, population density, accessibility, and 
demand to calculate a suitability score. The Recommendation Engine provides the final 
results by suggesting the top five existing cafes in the area and predicting one new cafe 
type that can be successfully opened within the selected radius. 
4.1.3 Machine Learning Layer 
The Machine Learning layer serves as the core analytical engine of the system, 
responsible for processing complex spatial datasets and generating predictive insights 
for cafe site selection. This layer begins with a robust feature engineering process where 


      
 
12 
 
 raw data including competitor density within a 500-meter buffer, accessibility indices 
from OpenStreetMap, and demographic statistics from the 2021 Census are converted 
into numerical vectors. At the heart of this layer lies the Random Forest Classifier, an 
ensemble learning model that utilizes a collection of decision trees to evaluate these 
spatial features. During the training phase, the model identifies non-linear patterns from 
historical cafe performance data in Kathmandu, learning to differentiate between 
optimal and sub-optimal business locations. When a user interacts with the web-based 
GIS interface, the ML layer performs real-time inference by passing the selected 
coordinate spatial attributes through its trained forest of trees. Each tree contributes a 
vote toward a final suitability classification, ensuring that the recommendation is 
backed by a statistical consensus rather than a single variable. Finally, the layer outputs 
a suitability score which is passed back to the frontend for visualization, effectively 
bridging the gap between raw geographical data and prescriptive business decision-
making. 
 
Figure 4: Machine Learning Layer 
4.1.4 Data Layer 
The Data Layer forms the backbone of the proposed location-based cafe 
recommendation system by providing reliable and structured data for analysis and 
prediction. This layer integrates multiple real-world data sources into a centralized 
database, ensuring consistency and efficient data access across the system. All collected 
datasets are preprocessed to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize 
geographic coordinates before storage. 
The Google Maps dataset supplies detailed information about existing cafe in 
Kathmandu Metropolitan City, including their geographic locations, cafe categories, 
user ratings, and review counts. This data is essential for identifying competitors, 
analyzing cafe popularity, and ranking existing cafe within the selected 500-meter 
radius. 
The OpenStreetMap dataset provides geospatial and infrastructure-related information 
such as road networks, nearby facilities, and land-use patterns. These features help 


      
 
13 
 
 evaluate accessibility, connectivity, and environmental suitability of a location, which 
directly influence cafe success. 
The population census dataset contributes to demographic information such as ward-
wise population density and distribution. This data is used to estimate potential 
customer demand and footfall in the selected area. By combining these datasets within 
a central database, the Data Layer ensures accurate spatial analysis, effective suitability 
scoring, and reliable machine learning–based prediction of new cafe opportunities. 
 
Figure 5: Data Layer 
4.2 Use Case Diagram 
The system involves three main actors: the User, who wishes to open a cafe and 
interacts with the application to view maps, analyze locations, and receive 
recommendations; the Admin, who manages datasets such as census and map data and 
retrains the machine learning model to maintain accuracy; and the Map Service 
(OpenStreetMap/Google Maps), which provides the base map of Kathmandu 
Metropolitan City with zoom and pan functionalities. The user logs in using a Google 
account, views the interactive Kathmandu map, selects a cafe type, and pins a location 
to define the analysis area. Based on the pinned point, the system displays nearby cafes 
and suitability factors such as population, road access, and cafe ratings within the 
specified radius. Using this data, the system recommends the top existing cafes and 
predicts the most suitable type of new cafe to open in that location, while the admin 
continuously updates datasets and the ML model to ensure reliable and accurate 
recommendations. 
4.3 Data Flow Diagram (DFD) 
It provides a way to visualize how data enters and leaves the system, what changes the 
data, and where data is stored. 


      
 
14 
 
 DFD Level 0 
It defines the scope of the system by identifying the boundaries between the system and 
external entities, such as the User and external Data Sources (Google Maps, OSM, and 
Census Data). In this system, the user provides inputs like cafe type, and the system 
provides recommendations and suitability analysis as output.  
DFD Level 1  
It illustrates how user inputs are processed through various stages: authentication, data 
retrieval, spatial analysis, and machine learning prediction. This level highlights the 
interaction between functional components and internal data stores like the spatial 
database.

 The process begins with user login, followed by loading a map of Kathmandu 
Metropolitan City where users select their preferred cafe type and pin their desired 
location on the map. The system then analyzes a 500-meter radius (specified) around 
the pinned location and calculates the suitability of that area for opening a cafe based 
on various factors. If the location is deemed suitable, the system proceeds to 
recommend the top 5 cafes in that area and uses predictive analytics to determine which 
cafe type would be best to open there, finally displaying these results to the user. If the 
location is not suitable, system will automatically suggests the best location, and also 
users can return to pin a different location and repeat the analysis process until they find 
an appropriate spot for their cafe business.

This chapter details the technical steps, the mathematical foundations of the predictive 
model, and the software development lifecycle adopted for this project. 
 
Figure 10: Methodology Overview 
5.1 Multi-Source Data Acquisition 
To build a comprehensive recommendation engine, data is harvested from three 
heterogeneous sources: 
a) Google Places API: This is the primary source for identifying current market 
players. It provides the most "real-world" and updated dataset for existing 
businesses. 
a. Collection Method: We utilize the Places API via HTTP GET requests. 
For a specific pinned location in Kathmandu, the system triggers a 
nearby search or search text query. 
b. Parameters used:  
i. location: Latitude and longitude of the pinned point. 
ii. radius: 500 meters (adjustable). 


      
 
18 
 
 iii. type: Filtered for cafe, bakery, and restaurant. 
c. Extracted Attributes: Business Name, Place ID, Global Rating, Total 
User Ratings, and current operational status. 
d. Validity Check: Google data is validated by millions of users; however, 
to ensure "freshness," we only extract businesses with a business status 
labeled as OPERATIONAL. 
b) OpenStreetMap (OSM): Provides the structural framework for the analysis. We 
extract the "Highway" and "Amenity" layers to analyze road connectivity and 
existing urban infrastructure. Data is mined using the Overpass Turbo API. We 
execute a specialized query to extract all "Highways" (roads) and "Amenity" 
points within the Kathmandu Metropolitan City boundary. 
c) National Population Census (2021): Provides the demographic weight. 
Population density data is linked to ward-level shapefiles to estimate the 
potential customer volume in specific neighborhoods.  
To understand the "potential customer base," we integrate the latest official 
statistics from the National Statistics Office (NSO) of Nepal. 
a) Collection Method: Data is sourced from the Census Nepal 2021 Data Portal. 
We extract ward-level CSV files for Kathmandu Metropolitan City. 
b) Key Metrics: Population density (people per sq. km) and household counts at 
the ward level. 
c) Data Linking: Since census data is tabular, we perform a Spatial Join in the 
backend, linking the tabular population counts to a GIS Shapefile of 
Kathmandu’s administrative wards. 
5.2 Spatial Feature Engineering and Buffer Analysis 
Once the data is cleaned and standardized to the WGS84 coordinate system, the system 
performs "Buffer Analysis." 
a) Centroid Selection: When a user clicks on the map, the system captures the 
latitude and longitude (x, y). 
b) 500m Influence Zone: A circular buffer with a radius of 500 meters is generated 
around the pin. This distance is chosen based on urban "walkability" standards 
for food services. 

      
 
19 
 
 c) Feature Extraction: The system counts all existing cafes (Competitor Density), 
measures total road length (Accessibility Index), and extracts ward-level density 
(Demographic Demand) within this buffer. 
5.3 Multi-Criteria Suitability Analysis (MCSA) 
Following the methodology of Sarath et al. (2018), the system applies weighted scoring 
to these spatial features. This transforms raw counts into a suitability score. If a location 
has low competitor density but high population density and road accessibility, it 
receives a high "Market Opportunity" rank. 
5.4 Model Training 
The core of the system’s "Prescriptive Analytics" is the Random Forest Classifier. 
Unlike simple search tools, it predicts the optimal type of cafe for a given location based 
on patterns learned from successful businesses. 
5.4.1 Random Forest:  
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of Decision 
Trees during training and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes of the 
individual trees. 
The model chooses the best "split" at each node of a decision tree using Gini Impurity 
or Entropy. 
a) Gini Impurity (G): Measures the frequency at which a randomly chosen element 
from the set would be incorrectly labeled. 
  𝐺= 1−∑𝑃௜ଶ௖
௜ୀଵ . ...............................................................(1) 
(Where P i is the probability of an item belonging to class i). 
b) Entropy (H): Measures the level of impurity or "randomness" in the data. 
                     𝐻= −∑𝑃௜logଶ(𝑃௜)௖
௜ୀଵ  ......................................(2) 
c) Information Gain (IG): The model calculates which feature (e.g., population vs. 
road density) provides the most information to reduce entropy. 
𝐼𝐺=𝐻 (𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡)−∑ቆே೎೓೔೗೏
ே೛ೌೝ೐೙೟×𝐻(𝑐ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑)ቇ   ........................(3) 
5.4.2 Training Process  
a) Bootstrap Aggregating (Bagging): The model creates multiple subsets of the 
training data with replacement. 

      
 
20 
 
 b) Feature Randomness: In each tree, only a random subset of spatial features (e.g., 
just road density and competitors) is considered at each split to ensure diversity 
and prevent overfitting. 
c) Voting: The final recommendation (e.g., "Bakery") is the one predicted by the 
majority of the individual trees. 
5.5 Evaluation Metrics 
To ensure the recommendation system is reliable, the Random Forest model is 
evaluated using a Confusion Matrix to compare predicted vs. actual successful business 
types in Kathmandu. 
Table 2: Evaluation Metrics 
Metric Formula Description 
Accuracy  𝑇𝑃+𝑇𝑁
𝑇𝑃+𝑇𝑁+𝐹𝑃+𝐹𝑁 Overall percentage of correct predictions. 
Precision 𝑇𝑃
𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑃 Measures the quality of the positive 
predictions (how many predicted 
"Bakeries" were suitable). 
Recall 𝑇𝑃
𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑁 Measures the ability to find all suitable 
locations in the dataset. 
F1-Score 2×Pr𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛×𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙
Pr𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛+𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 The harmonic mean of precision and recall, 
providing a single score for model 
performance. 
 
5.6 Software Development Model: Agile Model 
For this project, the Agile Development Model is adopted due to its iterative nature, 
which is ideal for refining complex ML models and GIS interfaces. 
Phase 1: Planning and Backlog 
In this phase, we define the "Product Backlog," which includes setting up the 
PostgreSQL/PostGIS database and integrating the Google Maps API. 
Phase 2: Design and Prototyping 
The UI/UX is designed using React.js. An initial prototype of the interactive 
Kathmandu map is built, allowing for simple coordinate pinning.

Phase 3: Development and Iteration 
This is the core "Build" phase. The Random Forest model is trained on Kathmandu 
business data. The backend (Django/Flask) is developed to handle the spatial queries 
between the frontend map and the ML engine. 
Phase 4: Testing & Review 
The system undergoes unit testing for the spatial buffer logic and accuracy testing for 
the recommendation engine. Feedback is used to "tune" the hyperparameters of the 
Random Forest model to improve the F1-score.

EXPECTED OUTPUT 
The proposed system aims to deliver a functional web-based Geographic Information 
System (GIS) integrated with Machine Learning to assist entrepreneurs in Kathmandu. 
The expected outcomes of this project are divided into visual, analytical, and predictive 
outputs. 
6.1 Interactive Web Interface 
The primary output will be a platform-independent web application featuring: 
a) Authentication Module: A secure login system utilizing Google OAuth 2.0. 
b) Geospatial Dashboard: An interactive map of Kathmandu Metropolitan City 
(integrated via OpenStreetMap/Leaflet) allowing users to pan, zoom, and drop 
pins on specific coordinates. 
c) Parameter Visualization: A dashboard overlay showing real-time data for a 
500m radius, including population density, road accessibility, and existing 
competitor locations. 
 
Figure 12: Expected Output Web Interface  
6.2 Spatial Analysis Results 
Upon pinning a location, the system will output a detailed spatial report for the 500m 
buffer zone: 
a) Competitor Mapping: Visualization of all existing cafes within the radius. 


      
 
23 
 
 b) Suitability Metrics: A summary of collected datasets (Census, OSM, Google 
Maps) presented in charts or heatmaps to show why a location is or isn't suitable 
for the selected business type. 
6.3 Machine Learning Based Recommendations 
The core innovation of the project is the dual-layer recommendation output generated 
by the Random Forest model: 
Top 5 Existing Cafes  
The system will identify and list the five most successful existing cafes within the 500m 
radius. These are ranked based on: 
a) Average user ratings and review counts. 
b) Popularity and estimated footfall indicators. 
c) Location-specific advantages. 
New Business Prediction (The Market Gap) 
The system will provide a specific prediction for a new cafe type that has the highest 
potential for success at the pinned location. 
a) Market Gap Analysis: Identification of cafe types that are missing in the area 
despite high population demand. 
b) Saturation Logic: If the user’s selected cafe type is "over-saturated," the system 
will suggest an alternative type (e.g., suggesting a "Bakery" if "Coffee Shops" 
are too numerous).

TIME SCHEDULE 
7.1 Project Timeline Overview 
The "Map-Based Cafe Location Recommendation System" will be developed over a 
period of 8 weeks (2 months) following the Agile Software Development methodology. 
The timeline is designed to be intensive and iterative, allowing for the parallel 
development of the map interface and the machine learning model to ensure timely 
completion.

7.3 Detailed Task Breakdown  
The following Gantt chart illustrates the weekly distribution of tasks throughout the 
project lifecycle.  
The project follows agile model development approach. It begins with Planning and 
Requirements analysis in the first two weeks to define the system's scope and finalize 
the technical stack for GIS and Machine Learning. Overlapping with the second week, 
Data Collection and Design involves gathering spatial datasets from OpenStreetMap 
and census data, which provides the "raw material" needed for the subsequent phases 

      
 
25 
 
 As the data becomes available, Web Interface Development kicks off in week three to 
build the React map interface. To ensure efficiency, ML Model Training begins in week 
four, allowing to train the Random Forest algorithm on the data collected earlier. Once 
the interface and the "brain" (the model) are ready, Integration and Testing take place 
in weeks six and seven to ensure the recommendation logic displays correctly on the 
map. The final two weeks are dedicated to Deployment (setting up the live 
environment) and Documentation, ensuring all technical findings and user manuals are 
compiled into the final report for the Week 8 deadline.
